Meant as a starting point for using Docker with VSCode Tasks.

Install to .vscode/tasks.json (run in a project file):
```cmd 
curl -o ".\.vscode\tasks.json" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordan-hurley-dev/VSCodeDockerTasks/main/tasks.json"
```
> **Warning**
> This will attempt to overwrite any existing tasks. If this isn't what you want, you can just manually copy over the tasks
